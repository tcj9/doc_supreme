# Integrations

Convex integrates with a variety of supported third party tools for log streaming and exception reporting.

* [Log Streams](/production/integrations/log-streams/.md) enable streaming of log events from your Convex deployment to supported destinations, such as Axiom, Datadog, or a custom webhook.
* [Exception Reporting](/production/integrations/exception-reporting.md) gives visibility into errors in your Convex function executions.

## Configuring an Integration[​](#configuring-an-integration "Direct link to Configuring an Integration")

To configure an integration, navigate to the [Deployment Settings](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings) in the Dashboard, and the "Integrations" tab in the sidebar. This page provides a list of your configured integrations, their current health status, and other integrations available to be configured. To configure a integration, click on the card and follow the setup directions.

## Deleting an Integration[​](#deleting-an-integration "Direct link to Deleting an Integration")

To remove an integration and stop further events from being piped out to the configured destination, select the menu icon in the upper-right corner of a configured panel and select "Delete integration". After confirming, the integration will stop running within a few seconds.

Beyond integrations for logs and exceptions, [Convex Components](/components.md) make it easier to work with third party services. See the full list of components on the [Convex Components Directory](https://convex.dev/components).
