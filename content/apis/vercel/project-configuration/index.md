# Project Configuration

Vercel automatically detects your framework and sets sensible defaults for builds, deployments, and routing. Project configuration lets you override these defaults to control builds, routing rules, function behavior, scheduled tasks, image optimization, and more.

In addition to configuring your project through [Project Settings](/docs/project-configuration/project-settings), you have the following options:

- [Static file-based configuration](/docs/project-configuration/vercel-json) - Static JSON configuration in your repository
- [Programmatic file-based configuration](/docs/project-configuration/vercel-ts) - Dynamic TypeScript configuration that runs at build time
- [Global CLI configuration](/docs/project-configuration/global-configuration) - System-wide Vercel CLI settings

Each method lets you control different aspects of your project.

## File-based configuration

File-based configuration lives in your repository and gets version-controlled with your code. You can use either [`vercel.json`](/docs/project-configuration/vercel-json) for static configuration or [`vercel.ts`](/docs/project-configuration/vercel-ts) for programmatic configuration that runs at build time. Both support the same properties, but `vercel.ts` lets you generate configuration dynamically using environment variables, API calls, or other build-time logic. You can only use one configuration file per project.

The table below shows all available configuration properties:
