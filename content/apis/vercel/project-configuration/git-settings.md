# Git settings

Once you have [connected a Git repository](/docs/git#deploying-a-git-repository), select the **Git** menu item from your project settings page to edit your project's Git settings. These settings include:

- Managing Git Large File Storage (LFS)
- Creating Deploy Hooks

## Disconnect your Git repository

To disconnect your Git repository from your Vercel project:

1. Choose a project from the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar and select [**Git**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fgit\&title=Go+to+Git+settings)
3. Under **Connected Git Repository**, select the **Disconnect** button.

## Git Large File Storage (LFS)

If you have [LFS objects](https://git-lfs.com/) in your repository, you can enable or disable support for them from the [project settings](/docs/project-configuration/project-settings).
When support is enabled, Vercel will pull the LFS objects that are used in your repository.

> **💡 Note:** You must [redeploy your
> project](/docs/deployments/managing-deployments#redeploy-a-project) after
> turning Git LFS on.

## Deploy Hooks

Vercel supports **deploy hooks**, which are unique URLs that accept HTTP POST requests and trigger deployments. Check out [our Deploy Hooks documentation](/docs/deploy-hooks) to learn more.
