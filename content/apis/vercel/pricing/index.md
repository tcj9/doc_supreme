# Pricing on Vercel

This page provides an overview of Vercel's pricing model and outlines all billable metrics and their pricing models.

For a full breakdown of Vercel's pricing by plan, see the [pricing page](https://vercel.com/pricing/coming-soon).

To learn how resources are triggered through a real-world app scenario, see the [calculating resource usage](/docs/pricing/how-does-vercel-calculate-usage-of-resources) guide.

## Managed Infrastructure

Vercel provides [Managed Infrastructure](https://vercel.com/products/managed-infrastructure) to deploy, scale, and secure your applications.

These resources are usage based, and billed based on the amount of data transferred, the number of requests made, and the duration of compute resources used.

Each product's usage breaks down into resources, with each one billed based on the usage of a specific metric. For example, [Function Duration](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration) generates bills based on the total execution time of a Vercel Function.

### Managed Infrastructure billable resources

Most resources include an amount of usage your projects can use within your billing cycle. If you exceed the included amount, you are charged for the extra usage.
