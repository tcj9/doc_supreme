# Manage and optimize usage

## What pricing plan am I on?

There are three plans on Vercel: Hobby, Pro, and Enterprise. To see which plan you are on, select your team from the team switcher. Next to your team name, you will see the plan you are on.

## Viewing usage

The Usage page shows the usage of all projects in your Vercel account by default. To access it, open **Usage** in the sidebar from your Vercel [dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2Fdashboard\&title=Open+Dashboard).

To use the usage page:

1. To investigate the usage of a specific team, use the team switcher to select your team
2. From your dashboard, open **Usage** in the sidebar
3. We recommend you look at usage over the last 30 days to determine patterns. Change the billing cycle dropdown under Usage to **Last 30 days**
4. You can choose to view the usage of a particular project by selecting it from the dropdown
5. In the overview, you'll see an allotment indicator. It shows how much of your usage you've consumed in the current cycle and the projected cost for each item
6. Review the breakdown by project and region to understand the metrics causing the high usage

## Usage alerts, notification, and spend management

The usage dashboard helps you understand and project your usage. You can also set up alerts to notify you when you're approaching usage limits. You can set up the following features:

- **Spend Management**: Spend management is an opt-in feature. Pro teams can set up a spend amount for your team to trigger notifications or actions. For example a webhook or pausing your projects when you hit your set amount
- **Usage Notifications**: Usage notifications are set up automatically. Pro teams can also [configure the threshold](/docs/notifications#on-demand-usage-notifications) for usage alerts to notify you when you're approaching your usage limits
