# Deployment Protection Exception

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Deployment Protection Exceptions

You can use [Deployment Protection Exceptions](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/deployment-protection-exceptions#adding-a-deployment-protection-exception) to disable Deployment Protection (including [Vercel Authentication](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication), [Password Protection](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection), and [Trusted IPs](/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips)) for a list of preview domains.

When you add a domain to Deployment Protection Exceptions, it will automatically become publicly accessible and will no longer be covered by Deployment Protection features. When you remove a domain from Deployment Protection Exceptions, the domain becomes protected again with the project's Deployment Protection settings.
