To access Observability Plus features, you can start a Pro trial using the button below.

## Prorating

Pro teams are charged a base fee when enabling Observability Plus. However, you will only be charged for the remaining time in your billing cycle. For example,

- If ten days remain in your current billing cycle, you will only pay around $3. For every new billing cycle after that, you'll be charged a total of $10 at the beginning of the cycle.
- Events are prorated. This means that if your team incurs 100K events over the included allotment, you would only pay $0.12 over the base fee. Not $1.20 and the base fee.
- Suppose you disable Observability Plus before the billing cycle ends. In that case, Observability Plus will automatically turn off, we will stop collecting events, and you will lose access to existing data.
- Once the billing cycle is over, you will be charged for the events collected prior to disabling. You won't be refunded any amounts already paid.
- Re-enabling Observability Plus before the end of the billing cycle won't cost you another base fee. Instead, the usual base fee of $10 will apply at the beginning of every upcoming billing cycle.
