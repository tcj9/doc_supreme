# Redirects

Redirects are rules that instruct Vercel to send users to a different URL than the one they requested. For example, if you rename a public route in your application, adding a redirect ensures there are no broken links for your users.

With redirects on Vercel, you can define HTTP redirects in your application's configuration, regardless of the [framework](/docs/frameworks) that you are using. Redirects are processed at the Edge across all regions.

## Use cases

- **Moving to a new domain:** Redirects help maintain a seamless user experience when moving a website to a new domain by ensuring that visitors and search engines are aware of the new location.
- **Replacing a removed page:** If a page has been moved, temporarily or permanently, you can use redirects to send users to a relevant new page, thus avoiding any negative impact on user experience.
- **Canonicalization of multiple URLs:** If your website can be accessed through several URLs (e.g., `acme.com/home`, `home.acme.com`, or `www.acme.com`), you can choose a canonical URL and use redirects to guide traffic from the other URLs to the chosen one.
- **Geolocation-based redirects:** Redirects can be configured to consider the source country of requests, enabling tailored experiences for users based on their geographic location.

We recommend using status code `307` or `308` to avoid the ambiguity of non `GET` methods, which is necessary when your application needs to redirect a public API.

## Implementing redirects

Review the table below to understand which redirect method best fits your use case:

| Redirect method                                                    | Use case                                                                                                                                       | Definition location               |

### Vercel Functions

Use Vercel Functions to implement any redirect logic you need. This may not be optimal depending on the use case.

Any route can redirect requests like so:

```ts filename="pages/api/handler.ts" framework=nextjs
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default function handler(
  request: NextApiRequest,
  response: NextApiResponse,
) {
  // Use 308 for a permanent redirect, 307 for a temporary redirect
  return response.redirect(307, '/new-route');
}
```

```js filename="pages/api/handler.js" framework=nextjs
export default function handler(request, response) {
  // Use 308 for a permanent redirect, 307 for a temporary redirect
  return response.redirect(307, '/new-route');
}
```

```ts filename="app/api/route.ts" framework=nextjs-app
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  redirect('https://nextjs.org/');
}
```

```js filename="app/api/route.js" framework=nextjs-app
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export async function GET(request) {
  redirect('https://nextjs.org/');
}
```

```ts filename="src/routes/user/+layout.server.ts" framework=sveltekit
import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load = (({ locals }) => {
  if (!locals.user) {
    throw redirect(307, '/login');
  }
}) satisfies LayoutServerLoad;
```

```js filename="src/routes/user/+layout.server.js" framework=sveltekit
import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';

/** @type {import('./$types').LayoutServerLoad} */
export function load({ locals }) {
  if (!locals.user) {
    throw redirect(307, '/login');
  }
}
```

```ts filename="server/api/foo.get.ts" framework=nuxt
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  return sendRedirect(event, '/path/redirect/to', 307);
});
```

```js filename="server/api/foo.get.js" framework=nuxt
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  return sendRedirect(event, '/path/redirect/to', 307);
});
```

```ts filename="api/handler.ts" framework=other
import type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';

export default function handler(
  request: VercelRequest,
  response: VercelResponse,
) {
  // Use 308 for a permanent redirect, 307 for a temporary redirect
  return response.redirect(307, '/new-route');
}
```

```js filename="api/handler.js" framework=other
export default function handler(request, response) {
  // Use 308 for a permanent redirect, 307 for a temporary redirect
  return response.redirect(307, '/new-route');
}
```

### Middleware

For dynamic, critical redirects that need to run on every request, you can use [Middleware](/docs/routing-middleware) and [Edge Config](/docs/storage/edge-config).

Redirects can be stored in an Edge Config and instantly read from Middleware. This enables you to update redirect values without having to redeploy your website.

[Deploy a template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/maintenance-page) to get started.

### Domain Redirects

You can redirect a `www` subdomain to an apex domain, or other domain redirects, through the [Domains](/docs/projects/domains/deploying-and-redirecting#redirecting-domains) section of the dashboard.

### Firewall Redirects

In emergency situations, you can also define redirects using [Firewall rules](/docs/security/vercel-waf/examples#emergency-redirect) to redirect requests to a new page. Firewall redirects execute before CDN configuration redirects (e.g. `vercel.json` or `next.config.js`) are evaluated.

## Redirect status codes

- **307 Temporary Redirect**: Not cached by client, the method and body never changed. This type of redirect does not affect SEO and search engines will treat them as normal redirects.
- **302 Found**: Not cached by client, the method may or may not be changed to `GET`.
- **308 Permanent Redirect**: Cached by client, the method and body never changed. This type of redirect does not affect SEO and search engines will treat them as normal redirects.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Cached by client, the method may or may not be changed to `GET`.

## Observing redirects

You can observe your redirect performance using Observability. The **Edge Requests** tab shows request counts and cache status for your redirected routes, helping you understand traffic patterns and validate that redirects are working as expected. You can filter by redirect location to analyze specific redirect paths.

Learn more in the [Observability Insights](/docs/observability/insights#edge-requests) documentation.

## Draining redirects

You can export redirect data by draining logs from your application. Redirect events appear in your runtime logs, allowing you to analyze redirect patterns, debug redirect chains, and track how users move through your site.

To get started, configure a [logs drain](/docs/drains/using-drains).

## Automatic URL normalization

Vercel's CDN automatically normalizes certain URL patterns and redirects with a `308` status code. These normalizations happen before your redirects, rewrites, or application code runs.

### Consecutive slashes

The CDN normalizes URLs containing consecutive slashes (e.g., `//`) to single slashes and redirects with a `308` status code.

For example:

- `/blog//post` redirects to `/blog/post`
- `//about` redirects to `/about`

### Case sensitivity

The CDN does **not** normalize URL paths to lowercase. URLs are case-sensitive, and requests are served exactly as specified.

For example, `/About` and `/about` are treated as different paths. If no content exists at the requested path with the given case, the CDN returns a `404` response.

## Best practices for implementing redirects

There are some best practices to keep in mind when implementing redirects in your application:

1. **Test thoroughly**: Test your redirects thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. Use a [preview deployment](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production) to test redirects before deploying them to production
2. **Use relative paths**: Use relative paths in your `destination` field to avoid hardcoding your domain name
3. **Use permanent redirects**: Use [permanent redirects](#adding-redirects "Adding Redirects") for permanent URL changes and [temporary redirects](#adding-redirects "Adding Redirects") for temporary changes
4. **Use wildcards carefully**: Wildcards can be powerful but should be used with caution. For example, if you use a wildcard in a source rule that matches any URL path, you could inadvertently redirect all incoming requests to a single destination, effectively breaking your site.
5. **Prioritize HTTPS**: Use redirects to enforce HTTPS for all requests to your domain
