# Managing Usage & Costs

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Speed Insights

This guide covers how to measure and reduce your Speed Insights usage using the [`@vercel/speed-insights`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/speed-insights) package.

## Understanding usage

Your Speed Insights usage over time is displayed under the **Speed Insights** section of the [Usage](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F~%2Fusage%23speed-insights\&title=Go%20to%20Usage) section in the sidebar on your dashboard.

To learn more about data points and how they are calculated, see [Understanding data points](/docs/speed-insights/metrics#understanding-data-points).

## Reducing usage

To reduce the number of data points collected, you can configure the `@vercel/speed-insights` package with the following options. First, install the package if you haven't already:

```bash
npm i @vercel/speed-insights
```

Then configure one or both of the following options:

### Adjusting `sampleRate`

The [`sampleRate`](/docs/speed-insights/package#samplerate) option determines the percentage of events sent to Vercel. By default, all events are sent. Lowering this value reduces the number of data points collected, which can lower costs while still providing statistically meaningful performance data.

For example, setting `sampleRate` to `0.5` means only 50% of page views will send performance metrics:

> **💡 Note:** Lower sample rates reduce costs but may decrease data accuracy for low-traffic pages.

### Filtering pages with `beforeSend`

The [`beforeSend`](/docs/speed-insights/package#beforesend) option lets you filter or modify events before they reach Vercel. You can use this to exclude specific pages from tracking, which reduces the total number of data points collected.

Common use cases include:

- Excluding internal or admin pages that don't need performance monitoring
- Excluding pages that aren't user-facing

#### Excluding specific pages

To exclude events from specific paths, return `null` from the `beforeSend` function:

```tsx
<SpeedInsights
  beforeSend={(data) => {
    // Exclude admin pages
    if (data.url.includes('/admin')) {
      return null;
    }
    // Exclude internal tools
    if (data.url.includes('/internal')) {
      return null;
    }
    return data;
  }}
/>
```

#### Including only specific pages

If you want to track only certain pages, you can invert the logic to create an allowlist:

```tsx
<SpeedInsights
  beforeSend={(data) => {
    // Only track the homepage and product pages
    const allowedPaths = ['/', '/products', '/pricing'];
    const currentPath = new URL(data.url).pathname;

    if (allowedPaths.some((path) => currentPath.startsWith(path))) {
      return data;
    }
    return null;
  }}
/>
```

#### Combining `sampleRate` and `beforeSend`

For maximum cost control, you can combine both options. The `sampleRate` determines at page load whether to collect vitals, then `beforeSend` filters events before sending:

```tsx
<SpeedInsights
  sampleRate={0.5}
  beforeSend={(data) => {
    // Exclude admin pages entirely
    if (data.url.includes('/admin')) {
      return null;
    }
    // Of the 50% of page views sampled, admin pages will be excluded
    return data;
  }}
/>
```
