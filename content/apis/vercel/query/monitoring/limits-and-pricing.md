# Limits and Pricing for Monitoring

## Pricing

Monitoring has become part of Observability, and is therefore included with Observability Plus at no additional cost. If you are currently paying for Monitoring, you should [migrate](/docs/observability#enabling-observability-plus) to Observability Plus to get access to additional product features with a longer retention period for the same base fee.

To learn more, see [Limits and Pricing for Observability](/docs/observability/limits-and-pricing).

## Limitations

| Limit          | Pro           | Enterprise              |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Data retention | 30 days       | 90 days                 |
| Granularity    | 1 day, 1 hour | 1 day, 1 hour, 5 minute |

## How are events counted?

Vercel creates an event each time a request is made to your website. These events include unique parameters such as execution time. For a complete list, [see the visualize clause docs](/docs/observability/monitoring/monitoring-reference#visualize).
