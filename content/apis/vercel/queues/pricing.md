# Pricing and Limits

Vercel Queues is billed per API operation. Every API call counts as one operation, and there are five operation types:

| Operation             | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Send**              | Publishing a message to a topic                       |
| **Receive**           | Retrieving messages from a consumer group             |
| **Delete**            | Acknowledging a message after processing              |
| **Visibility change** | Extending or modifying a message's visibility timeout |
| **Notify**            | Push mode callback delivery to your function          |

## Pricing

Messages are metered in 4 KiB chunks. For example, a 12 KiB message counts as three operations.

Sends with an idempotency key and push deliveries with max concurrency are billed at 2x units for that operation. Other operations on the same message are unaffected.

Operations are [regionally priced](/docs/pricing/regional-pricing) like other Managed Infrastructure resources. See [pricing](/docs/pricing) for plan details and included credits.

Functions invoked by Queues in push mode continue to be charged at the [existing compute rates](/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing).
