# Access Roles

Vercel distinguishes between different roles to help manage team members' access levels and permissions. These roles are categorized into two groups: team level and project level roles. Team level roles are applicable to the entire team, affecting all projects within that team. Project level roles are confined to individual projects.

The two groups are further divided into specific roles, each with its own set of permissions and responsibilities. These roles are designed to provide a balance between autonomy and security, ensuring that team members have the access they need to perform their tasks while maintaining the integrity of the team and its resources.

## Team level roles

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Team level roles

Team level roles are designed to provide a broad level of control and access to the team as a whole. These roles are assigned to individuals and apply to all projects within the team, ensuring centralized control and access while upholding the team's security and integrity.

| Role                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Owner role

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: The owner role

| About                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**            | The owner role is the highest level of authority within a team, possessing comprehensive access and control over all team and [project settings](/docs/projects/overview#project-settings).                                                                                                                                              |
| **Key Responsibilities**   | - Oversee and manage all team resources and projects  - Modify team settings, including [billing](#billing-role) and [member](#member-role) roles  - Grant or revoke access to team projects and determine project-specific roles for members  - Access and modify all projects, including their settings and deployments |
| **Access and Permissions** | Owners have unrestricted access to all team functionalities, can modify all settings, and change other members' roles.  Team owners inherently act as [project administrators](#project-administrators) for every project within the team, ensuring that they can manage individual projects' settings and deployments.             |

Teams can have more than one owner. For continuity, we recommend that at least two individuals have owner permissions. Additional owners can be added without any impact on existing ownership. Keep in mind that role changes, including assignment and revocation of team member roles, are an exclusive capability of those with the owner role.

See the [Team Level Roles Reference](/docs/rbac/access-roles/team-level-roles) for a complete list of roles and their permissions.

### Member role

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: The member role

Members play a pivotal role in team operations and project management.

**Key responsibilities**

- Create [deployments](/docs/deployments) and manage projects
- Set up [integrations](/docs/integrations) and manage project-specific [domains](/docs/domains)
- Handle [deploy hooks](/docs/deploy-hooks) and adjust [Vercel Function](/docs/functions) settings
- Administer security settings for their assigned projects

**Access and permissions**

Certain team-level settings remain exclusive to owners. Members cannot edit critical team settings like billing information or [invite new users to the team](/docs/rbac/managing-team-members), this keeps a clear boundary between the responsibilities of members and owners.

| About                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Key Responsibilities**   | - Create [deployments](/docs/deployments) and manage projects  - Control [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables), particularly for preview and development environments  - Manage project [domains](/docs/domains)  - Create a [production build](/docs/deployments/environments#production) by committing to the `main` branch of a project. Developers can also create preview branches and [preview deployments](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production) by committing to any branch other than `main` |
| **Access and Permissions** | While developers have significant access to project functionalities, they are restricted from altering production environment variables and team-specific settings. They cannot invite new team members.  Only contributors can be assigned [project level roles](#project-level-roles); developers **cannot**.  Developers can deploy to production by merging to the production branch in Git-based workflows.                                                                                                                                       |

Central to the team's operational functionality, developers ensure a balance between project autonomy and the safeguarding of essential settings.

**Key responsibilities**

- Create [deployments](/docs/deployments) and manage projects
- Control [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables), particularly for preview and development environments
- Manage project [domains](/docs/domains)
- Create a [production build](/docs/deployments/environments#production-environment) by committing to the `main` branch of a project. Note that developers can create preview branches and [preview deployments](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production) by committing to any branch other than `main`

**Access and permissions**

While Developers have significant access to project functionalities, they are restricted from altering production environment variables and team-specific settings. They are also unable to invite new team members. Note that the capability to become a project administrator is reserved for the contributor role. Those with the developer role **cannot** be assigned [project level roles](#project-level-roles).

Developers can deploy to production through merging to the production branch for Git projects.

**Additional information**

To assign the developer role to a team member, refer to our [Adding team members and assigning roles](/docs/rbac/managing-team-members#adding-team-members-and-assigning-roles) documentation.

See the [Team Level Roles Reference](/docs/rbac/access-roles/team-level-roles) for a complete list of roles and their permissions.

### Contributor role

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: The contributor role

Contributors offer flexibility in access control at the project level. To limit team members' access at the project level, they must first be assigned the contributor role. Only after being assigned the contributor role can they receive project-level roles. **Contributors have no access to projects unless explicitly assigned**.

Contributors may have project-specific role assignments, with the potential for comprehensive control over assigned projects only.

**Key responsibilities**

- Typically assigned to specific projects based on expertise and needs
- Initiate [deployments](/docs/deployments) - *Depending on their assigned [project role](#project-level-roles)*
- Manage [domains](/docs/domains) and set up [integrations](/docs/integrations) for projects if they have the [project administrator](#project-administrators) role assigned
- Adjust [Vercel functions](/docs/functions) and oversee [deploy hooks](/docs/deploy-hooks)

**Access and permissions**

Contributors can be assigned to specific projects and have the same permissions as [project administrators](#project-administrators), [project developers](#project-developer), or [project viewers](#project-viewer). They can also be assigned no project role, which means they won't be able to access that specific project.
