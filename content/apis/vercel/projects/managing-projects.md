# Managing projects

You can manage your project on Vercel in your project's dashboard. To learn more, see [Project Settings](/docs/project-configuration/project-settings) and [Managing deployments](/docs/deployments/managing-deployments).

## Creating a project

> **💡 Note:** To create a project, you need an [Owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) or [Member](/docs/rbac/access-roles#member-role) role. If you have a [Developer](/docs/rbac/access-roles#developer-role) role, you'll need the [Create Project](/docs/rbac/access-roles/extended-permissions#create-project) extended permission. For more information, see [Access Roles](/docs/rbac/access-roles).

#### \['Dashboard'

To create a [new](/new) project:

1. On the Vercel [dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2Fdashboard\&title=Open+Dashboard), ensure you have selected the correct team from the team switcher.
2. Click the **Add New…** drop-down button and select **Project**:

![Image](`/docs-assets/static/docs/concepts/projects/add-new-project-light.png`)

3. You can either [import from an existing Git repository](/docs/git) or use one of our [templates](/templates). For more information, see our [Getting Started with Vercel](/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/projects-deployments).
4. If you choose to import from a Git repository, you'll be prompted to select the repository you want to deploy.
5. Configure your project settings, such as the name, [framework](/docs/frameworks), [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables), and [build and output settings](/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#configuring-a-build).
6. If you're importing from a monorepo, select the **Edit** button to select the project from the repository you want to deploy. For more information, see [Monorepos](/docs/monorepos#add-a-monorepo-through-the-vercel-dashboard).

#### 'cURL'

To create an Authorization Bearer token, see the [access token](/docs/rest-api/reference/welcome#creating-an-access-token) section of the API documentation.

```bash filename="cURL"
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vercel.com/v11/projects \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "environmentVariables": [
      {
        "key": "<env-key>",
        "target": "production",
        "gitBranch": "<git-branch>",
        "type": "system",
        "value": "<env-value>"
      }
    ],
    "framework": "<framework>",
    "gitRepository": {
      "repo": "<repo-url>",
      "type": "github"
    },
    "installCommand": "<install-command>",
    "name": "<project-name>",
    "rootDirectory": "<root-directory>"
  }'
```

#### 'SDK']

To create an Authorization Bearer token, see the [access token](/docs/rest-api/reference/welcome#creating-an-access-token) section of the API documentation.

```ts filename="createProject"
import { Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk';

const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: '<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>',
});

async function run() {
  const result = await vercel.projects.createProject({
    requestBody: {
      name: '<project-name>',
      environmentVariables: [
        {
          key: '<env-key>',
          target: 'production',
          gitBranch: '<git-branch>',
          type: 'system',
          value: '<env-value>',
        },
      ],
      framework: '<framework>',
      gitRepository: {
        repo: '<repo-url>',
        type: 'github',
      },
      installCommand: '<install-command>',
      name: '<project-name>',
      rootDirectory: '<root-directory>',
    },
  });

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

## Pausing a project

You can choose to temporarily pause a project to ensure that you do not incur usage from [metered resources](/docs/limits#additional-resources) on your production deployment.

### Pausing a project when you reach your spend amount

To automatically pause your projects when you reach your spend amount:

1. On the Vercel [dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2Fdashboard\&title=Open+Dashboard), ensure you have selected the correct team from the team switcher.
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar.
3. In the **Spend Management** section, select the **Pause all production deployments** option. Then follow the steps to confirm the action.

To learn more, see the [Spend Management documentation](/docs/spend-management#pausing-projects).

### Pause a project using the REST API

To pause a project manually or with a webhook you can use the [REST API](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/pause-a-project):

1. Ensure you have [access token](/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) scoped to your team to authenticate the API.
2. Create a webhook that calls the pause project [endpoint](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/pause-a-project):
   - You'll need to pass a path parameter of the [Project ID](/docs/projects/overview#project-id) and query string of [Team ID](/docs/accounts#find-your-team-id):
     ```bash filename="request"
     https://api.vercel.com/v1/projects/<prj_ID>/pause?teamId=<team_ID>
     ```
   - Use your access token as the bearer token, to enable you to carry out actions through the API on behalf of your team.
   - Ensure that your `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`.

When you pause your project, any users accessing your production deployment will see a [503 DEPLOYMENT\_PAUSED error](/docs/errors/DEPLOYMENT_PAUSED).

```bash filename="cURL"
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://api.vercel.com/v1/projects/<project-id>/pause?teamId=<team-id>&slug=<team-slug>" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN"
```

> **💡 Note:** You can also manually make a POST request to the [pause project
> endpoint](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/pause-a-project) without
> using webhook.

### Resuming a project

Resuming a project can either be done through the [REST API](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/projects/unpause-a-project) or your project settings:

1. Go to your team's [dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2Fdashboard\&title=Open+Dashboard) and select your project. When you select it, you should notice it has a **paused** icon in the team switcher.
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar.
3. You'll be presented with a banner notifying you that your project is paused and your production deployment is unavailable.
4. Select the **Resume Service** button.
5. In the dialog that appears, confirm that you want to resume service of your project's production deployment by selecting the **Resume** button.

Your production deployment will resume service within a few minutes. You do not need to redeploy it.

## Deleting a project

Deleting your project will also delete the deployments, domains, environment variables, and settings within it. If you have any deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not want them to be removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom domain under a different project first.

To delete a project:

1. On the Vercel [dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2Fdashboard\&title=Open+Dashboard), ensure you have selected the correct team from the team switcher and select the project you want to delete.
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar.
3. At the bottom of the **General** page, you’ll see the **Delete Project** section. Click the **Delete** button.

![Image](`/docs-assets/static/docs/concepts/projects/delete-project-light.png`)

4. In the **Delete Project** dialog, confirm that you'd like to delete the project by entering the project name and prompt. Then, click the **Continue** button.
