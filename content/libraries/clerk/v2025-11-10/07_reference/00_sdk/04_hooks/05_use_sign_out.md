# useSignUp()

The `useSignUp()` hook provides access to the [`SignUp`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up.md) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up attempt and manage the sign-up flow. You can use this to create a custom sign-up flow.

## Returns

There are multiple variants of this type available which you can select by clicking on one of the tabs.

**Initialization**

| Name        | Type        | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `isLoaded`  | `false`     | A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.             |
| `setActive` | `undefined` | A function that sets the active session. See the [`reference doc`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/clerk.md#set-active). |
| `signUp`    | `undefined` | An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt.                              |

**Loaded**

| Name          | Type                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `isLoaded`    | `true`                                                                                                                                 | A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.             |
| `setActive()` | <code>(setActiveParams: <a href="https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/types/set-active-params.md"></a>) => Promise<void></code> | A function that sets the active session. See the [`reference doc`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/clerk.md#set-active). |
| `signUp`      | [`SignUpResource`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up.md)                                                             | An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt.                              |

## Examples

### Check the current state of a sign-up

The following example uses the `useSignUp()` hook to access the [`SignUp`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up.md) object, which contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-up/page.tsx' }}
'use client'

import { useSignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp()

  // Handle loading state
  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return <div>The current sign-up attempt status is {signUp?.status}.</div>
}
```

### Create a custom sign-up flow with `useSignUp()`

The `useSignUp()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-up flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-up flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignUp()` hook to create custom flows, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview.md).
