# <RedirectToSignUp />

The `<RedirectToSignUp />` component will navigate to the sign up URL which has been configured in your application instance. The behavior will be just like a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

## Example

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, RedirectToSignUp, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <RedirectToSignUp />
      </SignedOut>
    </>
  )
}
```
