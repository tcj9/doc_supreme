# <RedirectToCreateOrganization /> (deprecated)

> This feature is deprecated. Please use the [`redirectToCreateOrganization() method`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/clerk.md#redirect-to-create-organization) instead.

The `<RedirectToCreateOrganization />` component will navigate to the create Organization flow which has been configured in your application instance. The behavior will be just like a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

## Example

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, RedirectToCreateOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>
        <RedirectToCreateOrganization />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>You need to sign in to create an Organization.</SignedOut>
    </>
  )
}
```
