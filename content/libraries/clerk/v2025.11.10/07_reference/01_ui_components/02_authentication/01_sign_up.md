# <SignUp /> component

The `<SignUp />` component renders a UI for signing up users. The functionality of the `<SignUp />` component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-in and sign-up options](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md) and [social connections](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/overview.md). You can further customize your `<SignUp />` component by passing additional [`properties`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md#properties) at the time of rendering. The `<SignUp />` component also displays any session tasks that are required for the user to complete after signing up.

> The `<SignUp/>` and `<SignIn/>` components cannot render when a user is already signed in, unless the application allows multiple sessions. If a user is already signed in and the application only allows a single session, Clerk will redirect the user to the Home URL instead.

## Example

The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<SignUp />` component. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

If you would like to create a dedicated `/sign-up` page in your Next.js application, there are a few requirements you must follow. See the [`dedicated guide`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/guides/development/custom-sign-up-page.md) for more information.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
'use client'

import { SignUp, useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Home() {
  const { isSignedIn } = useUser()

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return <SignUp />
  }

  return <div>Welcome!</div>
}
```

## Properties

All props are optional.

Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the created user's unsafe metadata (User.unsafeMetadata).

## Customization

To learn about how to customize Clerk components, see the [`customization documentation`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview.md).

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview.md).
