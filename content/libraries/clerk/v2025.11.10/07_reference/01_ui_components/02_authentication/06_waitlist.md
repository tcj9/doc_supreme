# <Waitlist /> component

In **Waitlist** mode, users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch. [Learn more about additional features available in **Waitlist** mode](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access.md#waitlist).

The `<Waitlist />` component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.

> If you're using Next.js, the`<Waitlist />` component is available in `@clerk/nextjs@6.2.0` and above.

## Enable Waitlist mode

Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must enable **Waitlist** mode in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Waitlist**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/waitlist) page.
2. Toggle on **Enable waitlist** and select **Save**.

## Example

> Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must provide the `waitlistUrl` prop either in the [`<ClerkProvider>`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/clerk-provider.md#properties) or [`<SignIn />`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in.md#properties) component to ensure proper functionality.

The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/waitlist/[[...waitlist]]/page.tsx' }}
import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function WaitlistPage() {
  return <Waitlist />
}
```
