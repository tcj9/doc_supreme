# Build your own sign-up page for your Next.js app with Clerk

By default, the [`<SignIn />`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in.md) component handles signing in and signing up, but if you'd like to have a dedicated sign-up page, this guide shows you how to use the [`<SignUp />`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md) component to build a custom sign-up page.

To set up a single sign-in-or-up page, follow the [`custom sign-in-or-up page guide`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page.md).

1. ## Build a sign-up page

   The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md) component on a dedicated sign-up page using the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments).

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx' }}
   import { SignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   export default function Page() {
     return <SignUp />
   }
   ```
2. ## Make the sign-up route public

   By default, `clerkMiddleware()` makes all routes public. **This step is specifically for applications that have configured `clerkMiddleware()` to make [`all routes protected`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware.md#protect-all-routes).** If you have not configured `clerkMiddleware()` to protect all routes, you can skip this step.

   > If you're using Next.js ≤15, name your file `middleware.ts` instead of `proxy.ts`. The code itself remains the same; only the filename changes.

   To make the sign-up route public:

   - Navigate to your `proxy.ts` file.
   - Add the sign-up route to your existing route matcher that is making routes public.

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'proxy.ts', ins: [5] }}
   import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

   // prettier-ignore
   const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
     '/sign-in(.*)',
     '/sign-up(.*)'
   ])

   export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
     if (!isPublicRoute(req)) {
       await auth.protect()
     }
   })

   export const config = {
     matcher: [
       // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
       '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
       // Always run for API routes
       '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
     ],
   }
   ```
3. ## Update your environment variables

   - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignUp />` component is being hosted.
   - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-up` route directly.
   - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Already have an account? Sign in' link at the bottom of the component.

   Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls.md).

   ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
   ```
4. ## Visit your new page

   Run your project with the following command:

   ```npm
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
