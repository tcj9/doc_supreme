## Example

### Access the `Session` object

The following example uses the `useSession()` hook to access the `Session` object, which has the `lastActiveAt` property. The `lastActiveAt` property is a `Date` object used to show the time the session was last active.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/home/page.tsx' }}
'use client'

import { useSession } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoaded, session, isSignedIn } = useSession()

  // Handle loading state
  if (!isLoaded) return <div>Loading...</div>

  // Protect the page from unauthenticated users
  if (!isSignedIn) return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This session has been active since {session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
