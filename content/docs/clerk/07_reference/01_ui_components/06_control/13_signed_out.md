# <SignedOut>

The `<SignedOut>` component offers authentication checks as a cross-cutting concern. Any child nodes wrapped by a `<SignedOut>` component will be rendered only if there's no User signed in to your application.

## Example

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { SignedOut } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedOut>
        <div>You are signed out.</div>
      </SignedOut>
      <p>This content is always visible.</p>
    </>
  )
}
```
