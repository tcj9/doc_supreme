# Scheduling

Convex lets you easily schedule a function to run once or repeatedly in the future. This allows you to build durable workflows like sending a welcome email a day after someone joins or regularly reconciling your accounts with Stripe. Convex provides two different features for scheduling:

* [Scheduled Functions](/scheduling/scheduled-functions.md) can be scheduled durably by any other function to run at a later point in time. You can schedule functions minutes, days, and even months in the future.
* [Cron Jobs](/scheduling/cron-jobs.md) schedule functions to run on a recurring basis, such as daily.

## Durable function components[​](#durable-function-components "Direct link to Durable function components")

Built-in scheduled functions and crons work well for simpler apps and workflows. If you're operating at high scale or need more specific guarantees, use the following higher-level [components](/components.md) for durable functions.
