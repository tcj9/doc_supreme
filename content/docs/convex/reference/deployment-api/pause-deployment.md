# Pause deployment

```
POST 
/pause_deployment
```

Disables a deployment without deleting any data. The deployment will not operate until it is unpaused. While a deployment is paused, new functions calls will return an error, scheduled jobs will queue and run when the deployment is resumed, and cron jobs will be skipped. This means that no function calls or bandwidth usage will be charged while the deployment is paused, but storage costs will still apply.
